sensors for forest fires
 ABSTRACT:
The study analyses and concludes practical measures to combat forest fires .  The forest fires have become prevalent incidence that causes destruction of the ecosystem which beautifies the world .
 And we had bad experience followed by Australia ,the amazon “lungs of the world”. Being as an budding engineering student , I come forward to bring a small change which may stop this disaster, my idea for this might not unpredictable but its clear in the processing , the smoke and fire detectors alarms  significantly MQ5 Gas sensor module / CO/Methane Detector,   will be located  in the areas to prove to such upheavals which would sense and  prompt the necessary authority to fight out   and ranges of detection will be intergrated  and detector  with GSM Sim900A specifications and pinout is implemented and flame detector , Buzzer for alarm . Through connection module of GSM  with arduino  fire alarm system is connected with prior software for notifications is indeed effective and variable, that we can save many lives and trees from destruction. This module of GSM can be used in globally.  This analyses putsforth   one of the technically innovative   notions to control the unprecented activities and also requires the vigilance of the due forest officials act spontaneously to avert such events before it intensifies. Further the sensors are required for the vigilance is also cost efficient and demands the less human labour .                  
 smart electric meter
 Technically  solutions of RPA software in electric meter would hike up feasibility which will keep on updating record.
 People keeps on individual vigilant and create morale ethics towards the flourishing nature’s worthy rewards. 
I have completed, a CERTIFIED course on RPA automation.
 I conclude that the innovation would play a significant role in futuremore of the technological growth in future.
